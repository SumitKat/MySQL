Naming conventions for MySQL Database:


Database name should be same as that of project name:
ex->  if project name is "MY Web Site" , database name should be "mywebsite".


Table name shoud start with package name in which it resides:
ex->  if the package name is "Web App Development" , table names should be like ,   "CREATE TABLE wad_users;"


Field Name should be prefixed with 2-4 letters of table name and field name should always be small letters seprated by '_'
ex->  if the table name is users , fields name should be like , "user_id", "user_first_name".


All fields except auto increment, text and date must be defined NOT NULL and DEFAULT.
ex->  user_id  INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT , 
	  user_first_name  VARCHAR(30)  DEFAULT '' NOT NULL;


Reserved words in queries should be upper case to increase the readibilty:
ex->  SELECT user_id, user_first_name 
	  FROM wad_users
	  WHERE user_id = 'something';  


PHP must be defined and escaped before query:
ex-> <?php
		$email=addslashes($_POST['email']);
		if(empty($email)) {
			return false;
		}
		$query="SELECT * from wad_users where email='{$email}'";
	 ?>


All alteration for the table must be reflected in the databasename.sql file. It should start like mywebsite-1.0.0.sql.
-> If there are only some table alteration than it should be increased by 0.0.1
-> If there is some new table creation than it should be increased by 0.1
-> If Some tables are dropped than it should be increase by 1.0
-> All revision should follow a patter major.minor.[build[.revision]]
-> All version should be save in same directory
